    <string name="formula_description_1">Oscillations that occur under the influence of an external periodic force are called forced oscillations.</string>
    <string name="formula_description_2">In this case, the external force performs positive work and ensures the influx of energy to the oscillatory system. It does not allow oscillations to decay, despite the action of frictional forces.</string>
    <string name="formula_description_3">If the frequency of the external force approaches the natural frequency, there is a sharp increase in the amplitude of the forced oscillations. This phenomenon is called resonance.</string>

    <string name="about_text"><![CDATA[This app gives basic introduction into trains mechanic. It has the following features:<br><br><ol><li><b>Sequence</b>.<br><br><ul><li>Allows to create <i>custom sequence</i> with certain vagon count and certain mass, and then optimize they mutual arrangement to minimize risks while movement.</li><br><li><i>Random sequence</i> is the same, but creates random vagons count with random masses.</li></ul></li><br><li><b>Paths</b>. Choice of certain path from the list allows you to test train movement on the path. Also path info is available in the path menu.</li><br><li>The app supports english and russian languages.</li><br><li>Also you can write your questions and suggestions in the support.</li></ol>]]></string>
